ID,Column_Name,Description
1,fixed acidity,"This column is most acids involved with wine or fixed or nonvolatile.
(Advice: Do not evaporate readily)"
2,volatile acidity,The amount of acetic acid in wine which at this column is too high of levels can lead to an unpleasant. This means is wine contains the high vinegar taste.
3,citric acid,"When found in small quantities, citric acid can add 'freshness' and 'flavor' to wines."
4,residual sugar,The amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops. It's rare to find wines with less than 1 gram/liter. Wines with greater than 45 grams/liter are considered sweet.
5,chlorides,This column gives the amount of salt in the wine.
6,free sulfur dioxide,The free form of SO2 exists in equilibrium between molecular SO2 (as a dissolved gas) and bisulfite ion; it prevents microbial growth and the oxidation of wine.
7,total sulfur dioxide ,"Amount of free and bound forms of S02. This amount in low concentrations, SO2 is mostly undetectable in wine, but at free SO2 concentrations over 50 ppm, SO2 becomes evident in flavour of smell and taste of wine."
8,density,This column gives the density. The density of water is close to that of water depending on the percent of sugar and alcohol content.
9,pH,This column gives the amount of acid or wine basic. Describes how acidic or basic a wine is on a scale from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very basic). Most of wines are between 3-4 on the pH scale.
10,sulphates,"This column gives the amount of sulphates of contains in wine. A wine additive which can contribute to sulphur dioxide gas (S02) levels, which acts as an antimicrobial and antioxidant."
11,alcohol,This column gives the amount the percent content of alcohol in the wine.
12,quality,"This column gives the quality of the wine. Output variable; based on sensory data, scores between 0 and 10. This means, 0 is poor quality and 10 is high quality."
